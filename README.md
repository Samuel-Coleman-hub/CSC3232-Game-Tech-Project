# Space Defender (CSC3232 University Assignment)

This is a game I created for my Game Technologies & Simulations University Module.

Protect your ship from an alien invasion, use the vending machine to buy turrets and upgrades to help support your efforts.

The purpose of this assignment was to learn about the use of various algorithms and techniques used in game development such as:

   - The implementation of Newtonian Physics

- AI Pathfinding

- Simple AI State Machines

- Complex AI with Goal Oriented Action Planning

- Complex AI with Flocking

-  Advanced gameplay progression techniques such as MinMax Algorithm
